There you are! It's really true. Its really you. It's truly you, the beautiful Dawn. The one called... Girl. I've heard so much about you. Many an hour I've spent with your namesake, pondering the light of the moon, and its utility as a reflection for a sun barely awake from a dream. From morning through noon, I've seen the happy tree, heard its persistent song. A tale of a magical dream where I, my palette alive, painted the scene. Now ended, it's called "Dawn and a Walk on the Beach." These stories I've been told, as if some Greek legend of old. Are there more to be told, or are there still? Oh Dawn, the hymns, the haws. Mother of two precious souls. Ahlivia! and Ooria! Is that right? No, that can't be right. To me, they are a manifested reality of a song I wrote called "Are We Family." The product of some long past dream. Or one called "Josephine." The narrator paints a scene from some sort of fort where the river bends under cotton candy skies. And with his undisciplined mind recalls: I remember you there at the table, surrounded by all the day's plans. Your eyes were flickering. You were trying to let a coffee cup warm your hands.
It's true, I was born lost, and you were born to persevere, but honey, I'll walk into your paintings until I reappear. As a speck of comet tail dust. Through a blue-green northern light. A dream-like memory, flickering still, in your eyes' deepest ravines.
I thank you, Dawn, for every moment you spent in the ravines of mine. I look forward to seeing more of you there... or in any other happy dream.
Now, what were their names?! Pray do tell? The precious angels with a taste for a world completely possessed by the human mind. It would tickle my pride to hear it from their own mouths.
